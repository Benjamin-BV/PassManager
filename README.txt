PassManager Version 0.01

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THIS IN A PROFESSIONAL SETTING OR FOR VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION. THERE IS NO ENCRYPTION OF PASSWORDS ON THE SYSTEM (YET) 

PassManager is a password manager that generates and stores passwords on disk, 
locally for convenience. This program was created with the intention to NOT be used in a professional setting (as of this version)
as it does not securely encrypt passwords before storage since it is a password generator and searcher (currently).The search functionality may be slightly "glitchy" if ran in a terminal,
please run in a permanent terminal environment (such as powershell or VSCode) to see the password outputted

All code was written by their respective owners, and no AI or agentic systems assisted with code, or any assets used in this program

Stack used: Python, python's in-built random function, and Flask for front-end/UI (Not functional as of V0.01)
